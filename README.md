Uber Ajax Cart
==============

Description
-----------

The Uber Ajax Cart module provides integration with the Facebook Pixel,
allowing you to place a single pixel across your entire website to report
conversions, build audiences and get rich insights about how people use
your website.

The module handles the following Facebook Pixel events:

- ViewContent
- CompleteRegistration
- AddToCart
- InitiateCheckout
- Purchase

(last 3 are based on the Drupal Commerce integration).

Special Note For Backdrop CMS
-----------------------------

We ported this module but have not had cause to use or test it. 
Please, let us know if you test it and we can issue a release.

Not all features apply to Backdrop CMS, since there is no Drupal
Commerce for Backdrop CMS at this time. 

Installation
------------

1. Enable the Facebook Pixel module.

2. Create new Facebook Pixel on your Facebook Pixel page in Ads Manager
   (https://www.facebook.com/ads/manager/data_sources/pixels/).
